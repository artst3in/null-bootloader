    *** Release 2025.12.100 ***

    Initial release of Null bootloader, a minimal fork of Limine for LunaOS.

    Changes from upstream Limine:
        - Removed Multiboot 1/2 protocols (~1,900 lines)
        - Removed Linux boot protocols (~1,080 lines)
        - Removed Chainload protocol (~370 lines)
        - Removed ISO9660 filesystem (~580 lines)
        - Removed test kernels and branding assets
        - Rebranded to "Null" with LunaOS versioning (YYYY.MM.BBB)
        - Updated documentation and legal notices

    What's kept:
        - Limine protocol (the only protocol LunaOS uses)
        - Boot menu (for recovery mode and kernel selection)
        - FAT32 filesystem
        - PXE/TFTP network boot
        - BLAKE2B hash verification
        - All core boot functionality (memory map, SMP, paging)

    Future work (TODO):
        - Replace BLAKE2B with BLAKE3
        - Add Kyber post-quantum crypto support

    Based on Limine 10.6.0 by Mintsuki and contributors.
