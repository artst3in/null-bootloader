The above License covers the core Limine bootloader code as present inside the
official Git repository (https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine),
excluding any file with a license header overriding it.

The Limine project depends on several other projects which are pulled in by the
./bootstrap script, or, in the case of release tarballs, are shipped alongside
the core Limine code in the tarballs themselves, similar to ./bootstrap having
been already run.

These additional projects are NOT covered by the License at the top of this
file, but are instead licensed as described by each individual documentation
present therein.

A non-binding, informal summary of all licenses used by the Limine project and
additional projects it depends on, in SPDX format where possible, is as
follows:

- Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception
- 0BSD
- BSD-2-Clause
- BSD-2-Clause-Patent
- BSD-3-Clause
- BSD-Axis without modification
  (not SPDX, see: https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/bsd-axis-nomod.html)
- MIT
- Zlib
