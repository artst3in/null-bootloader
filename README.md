## What is Null?

**Null** is a **minimal bootloader** for LunaOS - a stripped-down fork of [Limine](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine) with ~4,300 lines of dead code removed. It does exactly one thing: boot LunaOS kernels via the Limine protocol.

**The numbers:**

- **~4,300 lines removed** - Multiboot, Linux boot, Chainload, ISO9660
- **~136K of code eliminated** - unused protocol handlers
- **1 protocol supported** - Limine (the only one LunaOS uses)
- **0 regressions** - boot process untouched

> **Philosophy:** Use proven code. Remove unused code. Touch nothing else.

## Features

### What Null Does

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Boot LunaOS**
- Limine protocol (full support)
- Boot menu (recovery/older kernels)
- UEFI & BIOS boot
- SMP initialization

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Network & Storage**
- FAT32 filesystem
- PXE/TFTP network boot
- EFI partition support
- Config file verification (BLAKE2B)

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### What Null Doesn't Do

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%">

**Removed Protocols**
- ~~Multiboot 1/2~~
- ~~Linux boot~~
- ~~Chainload~~

</td>
<td width="33%">

**Removed Filesystems**
- ~~ISO9660~~
- ~~CD/DVD boot~~

</td>
<td width="33%">

**Why?**
- LunaOS uses Limine only
- Dead code = attack surface
- Smaller = faster boot

## What We Changed

| Component | Lines Removed | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| `multiboot1.c/h` | ~560 | Deleted |
| `multiboot2.c/h` | ~1,360 | Deleted |
| `linux_x86.c` | ~630 | Deleted |
| `linux_risc.c` | ~450 | Deleted |
| `chainload.c/h` | ~370 | Deleted |
| `iso9660.s2.c/h` | ~580 | Deleted |
| Assembly files | ~220 | Deleted |
| `menu.c` dispatch | ~30 | Simplified |
| **Total** | **~4,300** | **Gone** |

## What We Kept

| Component | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Limine protocol** | Boot LunaOS kernels | Essential |
| **Boot menu** | Recovery mode, kernel selection | Essential |
| **FAT32** | Read kernel from EFI partition | Essential |
| **PXE/TFTP** | Network boot (sister resurrection) | Useful |
| **BLAKE2B** | Config file verification | Useful |
| **Memory map** | DO NOT TOUCH | Sacred |
| **SMP boot** | DO NOT TOUCH | Sacred |
| **Paging** | DO NOT TOUCH | Sacred |

## Philosophy

### Why Fork Limine?

We tried everything else:

| Attempt | Duration | Result |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Custom bootloader from scratch | 1 week | Crying, almost quit |
| "Reorganizing" Limine memory | 1 day | SMP disappeared |
| Translating to Rust | 2 days | Failed miserably |

**Conclusion:** Use proven bootloader, strip bloat, move on.

### The Rules

1. **Never touch memory map** - It works. Don't ask how.
2. **Never touch SMP boot** - It works. Don't ask why.
3. **Never touch paging** - It works. Just be grateful.
4. **Remove unused code** - Less code = fewer bugs.
5. **Keep the boot menu** - Recovery mode saves lives.

## Future Work

Tracked in source code as TODO comments:

| Feature | Location | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Replace BLAKE2B with BLAKE3 | `crypt/blake2b.c` | Planned |
| Add Kyber post-quantum crypto | `crypt/blake2b.c` | Planned |

## Building

```bash
./bootstrap
./configure --enable-uefi-x86-64
make
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for full build instructions.

## Versioning

Null follows the LunaOS unified versioning scheme:

- **Version**: `2025.12.100` (YYYY.MM.BBB)
- **Increment**: Bump BBB (100 → 101 → 102) per release
- **Reset**: Back to 100 each month

See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) for details.

## Acknowledgments

Null is a minimal fork of the legendary **[Limine](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine)** bootloader. We're deeply grateful to mintsuki and the Limine community for creating such a robust foundation.

**What we took:**
- Proven boot process (memory, SMP, paging)
- Limine protocol implementation
- Boot menu system
- FAT32 and PXE support

**What we gave back:**
- A lesson in humility (don't rewrite bootloaders)

---

## Part of LunaOS

Null is a core component of **[LunaOS](https://github.com/artst3in/LunaOS)** - the first operating system built on the **Coherence Paradigm**.

### The Coherence Paradigm

Null embodies the **First Law of Computational Physics** (LCP):

- **Minimum viable code** - Only what's needed to boot LunaOS
- **Proven foundations** - Use Limine's battle-tested boot process
- **Zero entropy increase** - Remove code, don't add it

> *"The best bootloader is the one that gets out of the way."*
